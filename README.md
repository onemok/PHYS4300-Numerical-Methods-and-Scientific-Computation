# [PHYS4300] Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing

## Description
Projects I completed as a Physics undergraduate student for PHYS4300 can be found in this repository. 
This course was taught by Professor Jan Engelbrecht at Boston College. 


>This course introduces students to a variety of numerical methods and then applies these methods to solve a broad range of scientific problems. These problems are mostly drawn from physics, but we attempt to also include several other disciplines, including chemistry, computer science, mathematics, economics, and finance. Numerical techniques for solving problems expressed in terms of matrix, differential and integral equations will be developed. Other topics we intend to cover includes statistical sampling, the mathematics underlying basic machine learning methods.

## Projects
* [Project 1: Newton-Raphson method](./Project_1)
* [Project 2: Period Doubling Bifurcations - Chaos and the Logistic Map](./Project_2)
* [Project 3: LU Decomposition](./Project_3)
* [Project 4: Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)](./Project_4)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Run these commands in terminal to check if you have the dependencies 
```sh
/usr/bin/xcodebuild -version 
which brew
g++ --version
which gnuplot
```
If not, install them
* [XCode Command Line Tools](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index.html)
* GNU ```brew install gcc```
* GNUplot ```brew install gnuplot```

### Executing program
Switch to /PHYS4300-Numerical-Methods-and-Scientific-Computation/Project 1

* To compile a C++ code, use:
```sh
g++ <filename.C>
```
* To run the C++ code:
```sh
./a.out
```
* To run .gnu files
```sh
gnuplot
load "<filename.gnu>"
````
