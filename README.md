# [PHYS4300] Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing

## Description
Projects I completed as a Physics undergraduate student for PHYS4300 can be found in this repository. 
This course was taught by Professor Jan Engelbrecht at Boston College. 


>This course introduces students to a variety of numerical methods and then applies these methods to solve a broad range of scientific problems. These problems are mostly drawn from physics, but we attempt to also include several other disciplines, including chemistry, computer science, mathematics, economics, and finance. Numerical techniques for solving problems expressed in terms of matrix, differential and integral equations will be developed. Other topics we intend to cover includes statistical sampling, the mathematics underlying basic machine learning methods.
